## Description

This repository contains a collection of interactive web forms designed to perform various operations. Users can input their data and perform actions such as calculating the square, factorial, and hypotenuse of numbers, checking for palindromes, finding the first largest word in a string, and more. The forms are intuitive and provide a user-friendly interface for carrying out mathematical and string manipulation tasks efficiently.

## Forms Available

1. **Name Form**: Allows users to input their first and last name.
2. **Number Form**: Enables users to input two numbers and choose mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3. **Square Form**: Calculates the square of a number entered by the user.
4. **Factorial Form**: Calculates the factorial of a number entered by the user.
5. **Range Form**: Allows users to input a start and end number and performs operations on numbers within that range.
6. **Pythagoras Form**: Calculates the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle using the Pythagorean theorem.
7. **Palindrome Form**: Checks if a word entered by the user is a palindrome.
8. **Case Form**: Converts the first letter of a word entered by the user to uppercase.
9. **Word Form**: Finds the first largest word in a sentence entered by the user.

## Usage

Each form has its own set of instructions and guidelines provided within the form interface. Users can simply input their data and click on the corresponding buttons to perform the desired operations.
